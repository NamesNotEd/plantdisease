we wanted to build an "other" dataset with images that may fool the model, we
collected images likely to be uploaded by random users from their phones, random
objects, plants that aren't cannabis and images with overlayed text. Many of
the sick samples were from sites that tend to add overlay text describing the
cannabis's condition.
